# COGS

This repository contains the dataset used in the paper "COGS: A Compositional Generalization Challenge Based on Semantic Interpretation", accepted to EMNLP 2020. 

## Dataset

The dataset can be found under `cogs/`. `dev` and `test` contain in-distribution examples and `gen` contains the generalization examples discussed in our paper. We used examples in `train` for our main experiment and `train_100` for the additional experiment in the appendix with increased number of exposure examples.
